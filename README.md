# Maia's Crossword Website

This website lives at [crosswords.maiamccormick.com](https://crosswords.maiamccormick.com/).

It's built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) on top of the [classic-martinb](https://github.com/martinbjeldbak/classic-martinb) theme, and deployed via Github Pages.

To preview the site, run `bundle exec jekyll serve` and navigate to `http://localhost:4000/`.

To generate and deploy the site, run `deploy.sh`.

## TODO

[] retheme
	[x] colors
	[] fonts
	[] header height at smaller widths
[] responsive
