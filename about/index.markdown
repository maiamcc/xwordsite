My name is Maia, and I'm a Brooklyn-based crossword constructor (among other things). Since 2019, I've been making puzzles of various sizes, quality, and levels of shitpostyness.

Other hats I wear include: <a href="https://www.chamberchoirs.nyc/" target="_blank">director of the New York Chamber Choir</a> (you'll see lots of musical clues in my puzzles), and <a href="https://contra.maiamccormick.com/" target="_blank">folk dancer/contradance caller</a>. In my free time, you can probably find me singing, dancing, baking bread, or making bad puns.
